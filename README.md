## Project Goal
To improve decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and increase overall profitability, we developed a comprehensive sales and shipping dashboard using Power Query and Power Pivot in Microsoft Excel. This dashboard provides real-time insights into our company's sales performance and shipping logistics.

## Contributions to the Project:
I played a central role in the project by serving as the primary data analyst and dashboard developer. My contributions included:

**1. Data Gathering and Integration:**
Using Power Query, I collected and transformed data from various sources. This involved cleaning, filtering, and merging datasets to create a unified data source for analysis.

**2. Data Modeling and Analysis:**
Leveraging Power Pivot, I designed data models to establish relationships between sales,customer, and shipping data. This enabled us to create meaningful insights, such as sales trends and product performance.

**3.Dashboard Design and Development:**
I created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using Excel, where executives and team members could access key metrics, charts, and reports. The dashboard featured dynamic slicers and custom visualizations, allowing users to filter data based on their specific needs.

**4.Real-time Updates:**
To ensure that the dashboard provided up-to-the-minute information, I established automated data refresh processes, so the team could make informed decisions based on the latest data.
